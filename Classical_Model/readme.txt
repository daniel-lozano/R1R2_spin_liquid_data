In this folder three sets of data can be found: the data for the classical low-temperature expansion (CLTE), for the self-consistent Gaussian approximation (SCGA), and for the classical Monte Carlo (cMC). In the each file, a python script is included to display the data.

In the CLTE_data file, the eigenvalues from the CLTE Hessian are provided for the spin-ice states and for the states obtained via iterative minimization.

In the SCGA_data file, the SCGA predictions for the structure factors are provided along with the temperature evolution of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$.

In the cMC_data file, the structure factors along with the thermodynamic data are found. In this file, we have also included a file named "Irrep_statistics" which contains cMC snapshots used to produce the irrep distributions found in the PNAS report.
