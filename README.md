The data is sorted for the classical and quantum in their respective folders. 

For the classical data, four folders can be found: CLTE_data, SCGA_data, and cMC_thermodynamics. In each folder the data corresponding to the method referred in the name of the folder is provided.

For the quantum data, there are two folders. 
    The folder named "PFFRG_Data" can be found, which contains PFFRG data and a Python plot script for order parameter susceptibility flows and structure factors.
    The folder named "HTSE_Data" has the coefficients of the series expansion to 8th order for Eg and T1 susceptibility series.
    
    Further information can be found in each folder.
