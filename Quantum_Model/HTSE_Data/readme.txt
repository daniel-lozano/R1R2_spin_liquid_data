Here, we provide the coefficients for the series expansion to 8th order for Eg and T1 susceptibility series.

Every series has a header, states the exchange parameters, then gives series coefficients for Eg and T1 susceptibilities.

Let a susceptibility series be of the form

$\chi = \sum_{n=0}^8   a_n  \beta^n            + O(\beta^9)
The coefficients a_0 through a_8 are given separated by spaces (4 in one line, 4 in next line and one number in 3rd line).
